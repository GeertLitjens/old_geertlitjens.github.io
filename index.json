Here we also use a bit of dropout for regularization. The last layer uses a softmax to obtain class # likelihoods (i.e. metastasis vs. non-metastasis) x = Flatten()(x) x = Dense(256, activation='relu')(x) x = Dropout(rate=0.2)(x) x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x) x = Dropout(rate=0.2)(x) predictions = Dense(2, activation='softmax')(x) # Now we define the inputs/outputs of the model and setup the optimizer.

For network training we need float32 and we want to normalize between 0 and 1. The function below performs this task.\ndef convert_sample(sample): image, label = sample['image'], sample['label'] image = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, tf.float32) label = tf.one_hot(label, 2, dtype=tf.float32) return image, label  Now we use the tf.data pipeline to apply this function to the dataset in a parallel fashion. We also shuffle the training data with a shuffle buffer (which is randomly filled with samples from the dataset) of 1024. Next we define batches of 64 patches for training and 128 for validation. Last, we prefetch 2 batches such that we can get batches during training on the GPU.\ntrain_pipeline = pcam['train'].map(convert_sample, num_parallel_calls=8).shuffle(1024).repeat().batch(64).prefetch(2) valid_pipeline = pcam['validation'].map(convert_sample, num_parallel_calls=8).repeat().batch(128).prefetch(2)  Now we just apply train and evaluate the model using our dataset pipeline. We pick the steps per epoch such that the entire training and validation set are covered each epoch. We keep the History object that fit returns to plot the loss progression later on. We now just do 5 epochs for illustration purposes. Feel free to experiment with the number of epochs. If you want to keep the best model during training you can use the Keras ModelCheckpoint callback to write each improvement to disk.\nhist = model.fit(train_pipeline, validation_data=valid_pipeline, verbose=2, epochs=5, steps_per_epoch=4096, validation_steps=256)   Epoch 1/5 4096/4096 - 101s - loss: 0.6756 - accuracy: 0.5501 - val_loss: 0.5228 - val_accuracy: 0.7527 Epoch 2/5 4096/4096 - 98s - loss: 0.4292 - accuracy: 0.8071 - val_loss: 0.3946 - val_accuracy: 0.8249 Epoch 3/5 4096/4096 - 99s - loss: 0.3165 - accuracy: 0.8675 - val_loss: 0.3634 - val_accuracy: 0.8390 Epoch 4/5 4096/4096 - 100s - loss: 0.2586 - accuracy: 0.8958 - val_loss: 0.3707 - val_accuracy: 0.8340 Epoch 5/5 4096/4096 - 99s - loss: 0.2260 - accuracy: 0.9118 - val_loss: 0.3353 - val_accuracy: 0.8568   If we are happy with our performance on the validation set we can check whether it generalized to the test set. Note that it is bad practice to look at your test set performance too often; you will start making modification to your network/training procedure to optimize test set performance which results in optimistically biased performance estimates.\ntest_pipeline = pcam['test'].map(convert_sample, num_parallel_calls=8).batch(128).prefetch(2) print(\u0026quot;Test set accuracy is {0:.4f}\u0026quot;.format(model.evaluate(test_pipeline, steps=128, verbose=0)[1]))   Test set accuracy is 0.8563   If we are happy with the performance we can write the model to disk.\nmodel.save(\u0026quot;./patchcamelyon.hf5\u0026quot;)  If you followed along with all the steps you should get a test set performance between 0.8 and 0.87. Differences occur due to different weight initialization of the network for example. To make network training more reproducible you can specify the random seed for the weight initializers manually. Note that the training process cannot be fully deterministic due to backpropogation step in the CUDNN library not being deterministic. I hope you enjoyed this brief tutorial, the next post will be about how to use our saved model to classify a whole-slide image.\n","date":1556106103,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556106103,"objectID":"d91c943005e36a04aff38d3b3151fa95","permalink":"https://geertlitjens.nl/post/getting-started-with-camelyon/","publishdate":"2019-04-24T13:41:43+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started-with-camelyon/","section":"post","summary":"This post is the first of a three post series on using deep learning to tackle the CAMELYON Challenge.

One part of the prize was the oppertunity to turn our research into an educational program for elementary schools, specifically ages 9 till 12. This post is a summary of my experience going through this process and showcases the things we developed. Luckily, we were not in this alone and we got great support from the Radboud Wetenschapsknooppunt and two of our PhD students: Meyke Hermsen and Maschenka Balkenhol. In addition, the kids from the elemantary schools also made a great introductory for us:\n  An \u0026lsquo;educational program\u0026rsquo; might sound a bit vague, so I\u0026rsquo;ll dive into some specifics. The idea was to develop in total six activities which the children could do under supervision of their teachers (and partly by themselves) which would guide them through the background and the different steps of our research. These activities would take place over the course of several weeks in which there would be lessons to prepare, execute, present, and provide feedback on the activities. In the end the children need to define their own research questions in relation to the activities and execute it. The biggest challenge was to build these activities in such a way that they stay true to our research results but are also understandable for children of varying ages.\nWe quickly decided to split our research into two separate components with separate activities which would come together in the final activity. The two components were: histopathological diagnostics and artificial intelligence. In the end we came up with these six activities:\n When are computers intelligent? What are applications of artifical intelligence you encounter? How do you train a smart computer? What is a diagnosis and how do you perform one? How does a pathologist do diagnoses? Diagnosing cancer with artificially intelligent computers.  The fist two activities were aimed at getting a discussion going in the classroom on what the definition of intelligence is. Think along the lines of: Is a calculator intelligent? Or a navigation system? Secondly, the children were asked to discuss this at home and find examples of devices in their own house which they think were intelligent. In the end we would provide them with what we, within this project, mean with artificial intelligence: a computer program which automatically learns by example and can generalize what is learned this to unknown situations; similarly to the way they learn new skills.\nThe third activity was the first real hands-on activity for which I adapted the excellent webapp Teachable Machine by Google. I translated the app to Dutch and made some fixes for tablets and phones so it would be easier to use in the classroom. My adaptation can be found here, with the source code here. This webapp allows you to train a three-class classifier with your webcam. One fun application is to turn hand-gestures into instruments, as depicted in the video below.\n  The idea of this activity was that children can figure out what a computer can easily learn and what is more difficult. For example, if you teach it to react to your face, will it also react to your friend\u0026rsquo;s face? Can it discriminate between your left and right hand? And if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, what do you need to do to make it learn the difference. Many challenges that actually appear in machine learning, like bias, can be explored this way in a playful manner.\nThe next two activities completely moved away from artifical intelligence and focused on a key job of a doctor: obtaining a diagnosis. In activity 4 we developed several disease scenarios and the children had to identify what questions you need to ask to figure out what disease the person has. Specifically, we had a scenario where a child was either suffering from food poisoning or the flu. This activity intends to show how the process of a diagnosis works and how, by asking the right questions, you can narrow down your options and eventually figure out what ails the patient.\nActivity 5 move to the domain of histopathology. Here we introduced the microscope and concept of \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; cells and \u0026lsquo;bad\u0026rsquo; cells (cancer). We prepared a lot of images (one example below) to show the children the differences in appearance and how a pathologist, with a microscope, can see what is wrong with a patient. We also gave them a couple of images were they had to figure out themselves what were the good and bad cells.\nThe last activity combined artificial intelligence and histopathological diagnostics. Here again we used a webapp (source here) which I made based of the face classifier by Brendan Sudol. Here the students could upload images with cells and the computer would tell them whether they were good or bad. Initially they had to classify these images themselves and then see if the computer agreed. Additionally, they could try to find cases were they think the computer was wrong and see if a pattern could be established. This way they could interactively explore the limitations of this simple \u0026lsquo;smart\u0026rsquo; computer system.\n Example of the webapp for cell classification.   After the activities were finished a group of teacher at elementary school \u0026lsquo;de Gazelle\u0026rsquo; in Arnhem tested the lessons at their school. We visited roughly halfway and gave a presentation after which the kids had the oppertunity to ask questions. I had a lot of fun and got great feedback, both from the teachers and the children.\nCurrently, we are in the phase of wrapping up the project. Our package of lessions and activities will be bundled in a book such that other schools can also use it. This book will be available through the Radboud Wetenschapsknooppunt. Last, we will give a presentation about this project at the Winterschool organized by the Wetenschapsknooppunt for teachers to share our experience.\nAll in all, it was great to see the enthusiasm for our research in both the teachers and the children and for me it was a very rewarding experience. If you are interested in any of the materials or the project, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out to me.\n","date":1555674074,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555674074,"objectID":"346ee5dc3fa29f95f155a544b5f2fd38","permalink":"https://geertlitjens.nl/post/ml-for-elementary-school/","publishdate":"2019-04-19T13:41:14+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/ml-for-elementary-school/","section":"post","summary":"In 2018 Jeroen van der Laak and I were nominated and eventually won a Radboud Science Award for our work with the CAMELYON challenge.

Advances in computer-aided diagnosis have shown promise in improving histopathological diagnosis. We trained a deep learning system using data retrieved from the patients records to grade digitized prostate biopsies. Our system is the first that can automatically classify background, benign epithelium, Gleason 3, 4, and 5 on a gland-by-gland level in prostate biopsies. 532 glass slides containing 2162 prostate biopsies, evaluated by an experienced urogenital pathologist were collected and scanned. 596 biopsies were kept separate for evaluation, the remaining 1576 were used to train the deep learning algorithm (see table for Gleason grade distribution). A single label denoting the Gleason score (e.g. 3+4=7) was available for each biopsy, without information on tumor location or volume. To generate detailed annotations for training we used two previously trained deep learning networks to first segment the epithelium and, subsequently, to detect cancer. The Gleason grade from the patient record was assigned to the cancerous epithelium. These generated weakly annotated regions of tumor were then used to train a Gleason grading system. To evaluate, the system was applied to the biopsies in the test set. We used the total predicted surface area of each growth pattern to determine the Gleason score of the biopsy. Predicted tumor areas smaller than 15% of total epithelial tissue were considered unreliable (e.g. incomplete glands at the edges of the biopsy) and ignored for slide level classification. For predicted grades only areas larger than 5% of all epithelial tissue were considered, which is also common in clinical practice. Predicting whether a biopsy contains tumor resulted in an accuracy of 86% (linear weighted kappa (k) of 0.73, area under the ROC curve of 0.96). We compared the predicted primary Gleason grade to the one from the pathologistsâ report. Our system achieved an accuracy of 75% (k 0.64). On predicting the Grade Group (using primary and secondary pattern), our system achieved an accuracy of 67% (k 0.57). Misclassifications of more than one grade are rare. Our deep learning system automatically identifies Gleason patterns and benign tissue on a gland-by-gland basis. This can be used to determine the biopsy-level Grade Group and Gleason score, and show which parts of the tissue contribute to this prediction. Improvements need to be made to decrease misclassifications, for example in areas with inflammation.","tags":null,"title":"Automated Gleason Grading of Prostate Biopsies Using Deep Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

Patients were assigned to a âstroma-highâ or âstroma-lowâ group by both TSR methods (visual and automated). This allowed for prognostic comparison between the two methods in terms of disease-specific and disease-free survival times. Results: With stroma-low as baseline, automated TSR was found to be prognostic independent of age, gender, pT-stage, lymph node status, tumor grade, and whether adjuvant therapy was given, both for disease-specific survival (hazard ratioâ=â2.48 (95% confidence interval 1.29â4.78)) and for disease-free survival (hazard ratioâ=â2.05 (95% confidence interval 1.11â3.78)). Visually assessed TSR did not serve as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: This work shows that TSR is an independent prognosticator in rectal cancer when assessed automatically in user-provided stroma hot-spots. The deep learning-based technology presented here may be a significant aid to pathologists in routine diagnostics.","tags":null,"title":"Computer aided quantification of intratumoral stroma yields an independent prognosticator in rectal cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

The incidence is expected to increase further, due to the growing elderly population. This is leading to a significantly increased workload for pathologists. The burden of this time-consuming and repetitive workload has the potential to be decreased by computational pathology, e.g., by automatically screening prostate biopsies. The current state-of-the-art in many computational pathology tasks use patch-based convolutional neural networks. Developing such algorithms require detailed annotations of the task-specific classes on whole-slide images, which are challenging to create due to low availability of the pathologists. Therefore, it would be beneficial to be able to train using labels the pathologist already provides for regular clinical practice in the form of a report. However, these reports correspond to whole-slide images which are of such a high resolution that current accelerator cards cannot process them at once due to memory constraints. We developed a method, streaming stochastic gradient descent, to train a convolutional neural network end-to-end with entire high resolution images and slide-level labels extracted from pathology reports. Here we trained a neural network on 2812 whole prostate biopsies, at a input size of 8000x8000 pixels, equivalent to 50x total magnification, for a binary classification, cancerous or benign. We achieved an accuracy of 84%.

To enable fair comparison between the algorithms for this purpose, we set up the CAMELYON17 challenge in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2017 conference in Melbourne. Over 300 participants registered on the challenge website, of which 23 teams submitted a total of 37 algorithms before the initial deadline. Participants were provided with 899 whole-slide images for developing their algorithms.The developed algorithms were evaluated based on the test set encompassing 100 patients and 500 whole-slide images. The evaluation metric used was a quadratic weighted Cohentextquoterights kappa. We discuss the algorithmic details of the ten best preconference and two post-conference submissions. All these participants used convolutional neural networks in combination with pre- and postprocessing steps. Algorithms differed mostly in neural network architecture, training strategy and pre- and postprocessing methodology. Overall, the kappa metric ranged from 0.89 to -0.13 across all submissions. The best results were obtained with pre-trained architectures such as ResNet. Confusion matrix analysis revealed that all participants struggled with reliably identifying isolated tumor cells, the smallest type of metastasis, with detection rates below 40%. Qualitative inspection of the results of the top participants showed categories of false positives, such as nerves or contamination, which could be targets for further optimization. Last, we show that simple combinations of the top algorithms result in higher kappa metric values than any algorithm individually, with 0.93 for the best combination.","tags":null,"title":"From detection of individual metastases to classification of lymph node status at the patient level: the CAMELYON17 challenge","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"   ","date":1531872000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531872000,"objectID":"f7d5bd3fa141b6324f1d3a3f59248fcf","permalink":"https://geertlitjens.nl/media/wetenschapvandaag-zomercollege/","publishdate":"2019-04-23T21:33:47+02:00","relpermalink":"/media/wetenschapvandaag-zomercollege/","section":"media","summary":"For a special series of Summer Mini-Lectures Jeroen van der Laak and I were interviewed by Karlijn Meinders on AI in diagnostic pathology.","tags":[],"title":"BNR Wetenschap Vandaag - Zomercollege","type":"media"},{"authors":["W.

The most common strategy to assess the regional lymph node status is the sentinel lymph node procedure. The sentinel lymph node is the most likely lymph node to contain metastasized cancer cells and is excised, histopathologically processed and examined by the pathologist. This tedious examination process is time-consuming and can lead to small metastases being missed. However, recent advances in whole-slide imaging and machine learning have opened an avenue for analysis of digitized lymph node sections with computer algorithms. For example, convolutional neural networks, a type of machine learning algorithm, are able to automatically detect cancer metastases in lymph nodes with high accuracy. To train machine learning models, large, well-curated datasets are needed. Results: We released a dataset of 1399 annotated whole-slide images of lymph nodes, both with and without metastases, in total three terabytes of data in the context of the CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 Grand Challenges. Slides were collected from five different medical centers to cover a broad range of image appearance and staining variations. Each whole-slide image has a slide-level label indicating whether it contains no metastases, macro-metastases, micro-metastases or isolated tumor cells. Furthermore, for 209 whole-slide images, detailed hand-drawn contours for all metastases are provided. Last, open-source software tools to visualize and interact with the data have been made available. Conclusions: A unique dataset of annotated, whole-slide digital histopathology images has been provided with high potential for re-use.","tags":null,"title":"1399 H\u0026E-stained sentinel lymph node sections of breast cancer patients: the CAMELYON dataset","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Geert Litjens"],"categories":null,"content":"This presentation showed applications of deep learning for diagnostic histopathology.

This procedure, however, is time-consuming and error-prone. We developed a method to automatically detect mitotic figures in breast cancer tissue sections based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Application of CNNs to hematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026E) stained histological tissue sections is hampered by: (1) noisy and expensive reference standards established by pathologists, (2) lack of generalization due to staining variation across laboratories, and (3) high computational requirements needed to process gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). In this paper, we present a method to train and evaluate CNNs to specifically solve these issues in the context of mitosis detection in breast cancer WSIs. First, by combining image analysis of mitotic activity in phosphohistone-H3 (PHH3) restained slides and registration, we built a reference standard for mitosis detection in entire H\u0026E WSIs requiring minimal manual annotation effort. Second, we designed a data augmentation strategy that creates diverse and realistic H\u0026E stain variations by modifying the hematoxylin and eosin color channels directly. Using it during training combined with network ensembling resulted in a stain invariant mitosis detector. Third, we applied knowledge distillation to reduce the computational requirements of the mitosis detection ensemble with a negligible loss of performance. The system was trained in a single-center cohort and evaluated in an independent multicenter cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas on the three tasks of the Tumor Proliferation Assessment Challenge (TUPAC). We obtained a performance within the top-3 best methods for most of the tasks of the challenge.","tags":null,"title":"Whole-Slide Mitosis Detection in H\u0026E Breast Histology Using PHH3 as a Reference to Train Distilled Stain-Invariant Convolutional Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

Because of the large size of the tumor areas in radical prostatectomies (RP), this task can be tedious and error prone with known high interobserver variability. Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled development of automated systems that may assist pathologists in prostate diagnostics. As prostate cancer originates from glandular tissue, an important prerequisite for development of such algorithms is the possibility to automatically differentiate between glandular tissue and other tissues. In this paper, we propose a method for automatically segmenting epithelial tissue in digitally scanned prostatectomy slides based on deep learning. We collected 30 single-center whole mount tissue sections, with reported Gleason growth patterns ranging from 3 to 5, from 27 patients that underwent RP. Two different network architectures, U-Net and regular fully convolutional networks with varying depths, were trained using a set of sparsely annotated slides. We evaluated the trained networks on exhaustively annotated regions from a separate test set. The test set contained both healthy and cancerous epithelium with different Gleason growth patterns. The results show the effectiveness of our approach given a pixel-based AUC score of 0.97. Our method contains no prior assumptions on glandular morphology, does not directly rely on the presence of lumina and all features are learned by the network itself. The generated segmentation can be used to highlight regions of interest for pathologists and to improve cancer annotations to further enhance an automatic cancer grading system.","tags":null,"title":"Automated segmentation of epithelial tissue in prostatectomy slides using deep learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

However, as this assessment is generally performed visually by pathologists it can suï¬er from signiï¬cant inter-observer variability. The introduction of whole slide scanners facilitates automated analysis of immunohistochemical slides. Color deconvolution (CD) is one of the most popular ï¬rst steps in quantifying stain density in histopathological images. However, color deconvolution requires stain color vectors for accurate unmixing. Often it is assumed that these stain vectors are static. In practice, however, they are inï¬uenced by many factors. This can cause inferior CD unmixing and thus typically results in poor quantiï¬cation. Some automated methods exist for color stain vector estimation, but most depend on a signiï¬cant amount of each stain to be present in the whole slide images. In this paper we propose a method for automatically ï¬nding stain color vectors and unmixing IHC stained whole slide images, even when some stains are sparsely expressed. We collected 16 tonsil slides and stained them for diï¬erent periods of time with hematoxylin and a DAB-colored proliferation marker Ki67. RGB pixels of WSI images were converted to the hue saturation density (HSD) color domain and subsequently K-means clustering was used to separate stains and calculate the stain color vectors for each slide. Our results show that staining time aï¬ects the stain vectors and that calculating a unique stain vector for each slide results in better unmixing results than using a standard stain vector.","tags":null,"title":"Automatic color unmixing of IHC stained whole slide images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

We propose a novel data augmentation strategy that exploits the properties of the H and E color space to simulate a broad range of realistic H and E stain variations. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that data augmentation is performed directly in the H and E color space, instead of RGB. The proposed technique uses color deconvolution to transform RGB images into the H and E color space, modifies the H and E color channels stochastically, and projects them back to RGB space. We trained a CNN-based mitosis detector on homogeneous data from a single institution, and tested its performance on an external, multicenter cohort that contained a wide range of unseen H and E stain variations. We compared CNNs trained with and without the proposed augmentation strategy and observed a significant improvement in performance and robustness to unseen stain variations when the new color augmentation technique was included. In essence, we have shown that CNNs can be made robust to inter-lab stain variation by incorporating extensive stain augmentation techniques.","tags":null,"title":"H\u0026E stain augmentation improves generalization of convolutional networks for histopathological mitosis detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

Assess the performance of automated deep learning algorithms at detecting metastases in hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of lymph nodes of women with breast cancer and compare it with pathologists' diagnoses in a diagnostic setting. Researcher challenge competition (CAMELYON16) to develop automated solutions for detecting lymph node metastases (November 2015-November 2016). A training data set of whole-slide images from 2 centers in the Netherlands with (nâ=â110) and without (nâ=â160) nodal metastases verified by immunohistochemical staining were provided to challenge participants to build algorithms. Algorithm performance was evaluated in an independent test set of 129 whole-slide images (49 with and 80 without metastases). The same test set of corresponding glass slides was also evaluated by a panel of 11 pathologists with time constraint (WTC) from the Netherlands to ascertain likelihood of nodal metastases for each slide in a flexible 2-hour session, simulating routine pathology workflow, and by 1 pathologist without time constraint (WOTC).

Automated classification of histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs) is challenging owing to the wide range of appearances of benign lesions and the visual similarity of ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) to invasive lesions at the cellular level. Consequently, analysis of tissue at high resolutions with a large contextual area is necessary. We present context-aware stacked convolutional neural networks (CNN) for classification of breast WSIs into normal/benign, DCIS, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). We first train a CNN using high pixel resolution to capture cellular level information. The feature responses generated by this model are then fed as input to a second CNN, stacked on top of the first. Training of this stacked architecture with large input patches enables learning of fine-grained (cellular) details and global tissue structures. Our system is trained and evaluated on a dataset containing 221 WSIs of hematoxylin and eosin stained breast tissue specimens. The system achieves an AUC of 0.962 for the binary classification of nonmalignant and malignant slides and obtains a three-class accuracy of 81.3% for classification of WSIs into normal/benign, DCIS, and IDC, demonstrating its potential for routine diagnostics.","tags":null,"title":"Context-aware stacked convolutional neural networks for classification of breast carcinomas in whole-slide histopathology images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Geert Litjens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1497225600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497225600,"objectID":"8b4fd91410185488505bab11eb63c43c","permalink":"https://geertlitjens.nl/talk/kindergeneeskunde/","publishdate":"2017-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/kindergeneeskunde/","section":"talk","summary":"How will AI impact medicine, and specifically, pediatric medicine?

Traditional image analysis and computer vision techniques, such atlas, template matching, or, edge and surface detection, have been applied to solve this task. However, applicability of these methods is usually limited by the characteristics of the images used in the study datasets, while breast MRI varies with respect to the different MRI protocols used, in addition to the variability in breast shapes. All this variability, in addition to various MRI artifacts, makes it a challenging task to develop a robust breast and FGT segmentation method using traditional approaches. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the use of a deep-learning approach known as \"U-net.\" We used a dataset of 66 breast MRI's randomly selected from our scientific archive, which includes five different MRI acquisition protocols and breasts from four breast density categories in a balanced distribution. To prepare reference segmentations, we manually segmented breast and FGT for all images using an in-house developed workstation. We experimented with the application of U-net in two different ways for breast and FGT segmentation. In the first method, following the same pipeline used in traditional approaches, we trained two consecutive (2C) U-nets: first for segmenting the breast in the whole MRI volume and the second for segmenting FGT inside the segmented breast. In the second method, we used a single 3-class (3C) U-net, which performs both tasks simultaneously by segmenting the volume into three regions: nonbreast, fat inside the breast, and FGT inside the breast. For comparison, we applied two existing and published methods to our dataset: an atlas-based method and a sheetness-based method. We used Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) to measure the performances of the automated methods, with respect to the manual segmentations. Additionally, we computed Pearson's correlation between the breast density values computed based on manual and automated segmentations. The average DSC values for breast segmentation were 0.933, 0.944, 0.863, and 0.848 obtained from 3C U-net, 2C U-nets, atlas-based method, and sheetness-based method, respectively. The average DSC values for FGT segmentation obtained from 3C U-net, 2C U-nets, and atlas-based methods were 0.850, 0.811, and 0.671, respectively. The correlation between breast density values based on 3C U-net and manual segmentations was 0.974.

We apply and compare the proposed architectures for segmentation of white matter hyperintensities in brain MR images on a large dataset. As a result, we observe that the CNNs that incorporate location information substantially outperform a conventional segmentation method with handcrafted features as well as CNNs that do not integrate location information.

This paper presents a fully automated algorithm for standardization of whole-slide histopathological images to reduce the effect of these variations. The proposed algorithm, called whole-slide image color standardizer (WSICS), utilizes color and spatial information to classify the image pixels into different stain components. The chromatic and density distributions for each of the stain components in the hue-saturation-density color model are aligned to match the corresponding distributions from a template wholeslide image (WSI). The performance of the WSICS algorithm was evaluated on two datasets. The first originated from 125 H\u0026E stained WSIs of lymph nodes, sampled from 3 patients, and stained in 5 different laboratories on different days of the week. The second comprised 30 H\u0026E stained WSIs of rat liver sections. The result of qualitative and quantitative evaluations using the first dataset demonstrate that the WSICS algorithm outperforms competing methods in terms of achieving color constancy. The WSICS algorithm consistently yields the smallest standard deviation and coefficient of variation of the normalized median intensity measure. Using the second dataset, we evaluated the impact of our algorithm on the performance of an already published necrosis quantification system. The performance of this system was significantly improved by utilizing the WSICS algorithm. The results of the empirical evaluations collectively demonstrate the potential contribution of the proposed standardization algorithm to improved diagnostic accuracy and consistency in computer-aided diagnosis for histopathology data.","tags":null,"title":"Stain specific standardization of whole-slide histopathological images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["O.

Each MRL consisted of at least a 3D T1-weighted sequence, a 3D T2*-weighted sequence, and a FLASH-3D sequence. The reference standard was created by two expert readers, reading in consensus, who annotated and interactively segmented the lymph nodes in all MRL studies. A total of 5089 lymph nodes were annotated. A fully automated computer-aided detection (CAD) system was developed to find lymph nodes in the MRL studies. The system incorporates voxel features based on image intensities, the Hessian matrix, and spatial position. After feature calculation, a GentleBoost-classifier in combination with local maxima detection was used to identify lymph node candidates. Multiatlas based anatomical information was added to the CAD system to assess whether this could improve performance. Using histogram analysis and free-receiver operating characteristic analysis, this was compared to a strategy where relative position features were used to encode anatomical information.Adding atlas-based anatomical information to the CAD system reduced false positive detections both visually and quantitatively. Median likelihood values of false positives decreased significantly in all annotated anatomical structures. The sensitivity increased from 53% to 70% at 10 false positives per lymph node.Adding anatomical information through atlas registration significantly improves an automated lymph node detection system for MRL images.","tags":null,"title":"Automated multistructure atlas-assisted detection of lymph nodes using pelvic MR lymphography in prostate cancer patients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

Predictive markers of disease course and response to immunotherapy are urgently needed. Recent results have revealed the potential predictive value of immune cell phenotype and spatial distribution at the tumor site, prompting the need for multidimensional immunohistochemical analyses of tumor tissues. To address this need, we developed a sample-sparing, highly multiplexed immunohistochemistry technique based on iterative cycles of tagging, image scanning, and destaining of chromogenic substrate on a single slide. This assay, in combination with a newly developed automated digital landscaping solution, democratizes access to high-dimensional immunohistochemical analyses by capturing the complexity of the immunome using routine pathology standards. Applications of the method extend beyond cancer to screen and validate comprehensive panels of tissue-based prognostic and predictive markers, perform indepth in situ monitoring of therapies, and identify targets of disease.","tags":null,"title":"In-depth tissue profiling using multiplexed immunohistochemical consecutive staining on single slide","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"   ","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464739200,"objectID":"fdea8e0cc940dca62a478e5943bcfb57","permalink":"https://geertlitjens.nl/media/alpehuzes-interview/","publishdate":"2019-04-23T21:33:56+02:00","relpermalink":"/media/alpehuzes-interview/","section":"media","summary":"During Alpe Hu'Zes in 2016 I was given the honor to receive the Bas Mulder Award to continue my research.

This high incidence-to-mortality ratio sounds like a positive trait, but comes with its own share of problems: high risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment with significant patient morbidity. To combat overtreatment, several models have been developed to assign patients to risk categories with differing treatment regimes. Although these models show good correlation with patient outcome on the group level, their benefit for the individual patient remains limited.\n Prostate cancer segmentation using convolutional neural networks.   Several groups have shown that quantifying the tumour and its micro-environment at the cellular level can result in biomarkers with strong prognostic potential, for example tumour/stroma ratio, the presence and composition of immune infiltrates or the amount of proliferating (Ki67-positive) cells. However, these findings have not translated to clinical practice due to the cumbersome and subjective manual extraction of these biomarkers from tissue slides.\nRecent years have seen the more widespread introduction of whole-slide imaging systems, which for the first time allow computerized processing of tissue slides. Automated extraction of aforementioned quantitative biomarkers through image analysis can achieve the required accuracy and robustness to impact clinical practice. In tandem with these developments, computer vision has seen a machine learning revolution over the past decade due to the advent of deep learning.\nIn this project, we will combine deep learning and digitized whole-slide imaging of prostate cancer for reproducible extraction of quantitative biomarkers. Furthermore, due to the ability of deep learning systems to learn relevant features without human intervention, we expect to identify novel biomarkers which allow us to further improve the current risk models.\nThe aim of this project is to prevent unnecessary surgery and adjuvant therapy for individual patients by improving currently established risk models. Risk models will be enhanced through the addition of pre- and post-operative quantitative biomarkers obtained via image analysis and deep learning. We will focus both on the accurate and objective quantification of biomarkers already identified in literature and the discovery of novel biomarkers.\n","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462060800,"objectID":"e00b71851dc1664bd52e9c15d57a1f58","permalink":"https://geertlitjens.nl/project/deeppca/","publishdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/deeppca/","section":"project","summary":"Less unnecessary therapy for prostate cancer patients.","tags":["Active","Machine Learning","Prostate Cancer","Computational Pathology"],"title":"Deep PCa","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Overview Built on the success of its predecessor, CAMELYON17 is the second grand challenge in pathology organised by the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG) and Department of Pathology of the Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc) in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.\nThe goal of this challenge is to evaluate new and existing algorithms for automated detection and classification of breast cancer metastases in whole-slide images of histological lymph node sections.

Task The TNM system is an internationally accepted means to classify the extent of cancer spread in patients with a solid tumour. It is one of the most important tools for clinicians to help them select a suitable treatment option and to obtain an indication of prognosis. Since the histological assessment of lymph node metastases is an essential part of TNM classification, CAMELYON17 will focus on the pathologic N-stage, in short: pN-stage.\nIn clinical practice several lymph nodes are surgically removed after which these nodes are processed in the pathology laboratory. In this challenge we forged artificial patients, with 5 slides provided for each patient where each slide corresponds to exactly one lymph node.\nThe task in this challenge is to determine a pN-stage for every patient in the test dataset. To compose a pN-stage, the number of positive lymph nodes (i.e. nodes with a metastasis) are counted.

Identification of biomarkers is usually performed through immunohistochemical staining of cancer sections on glass slides. However, combination of multiple biomarkers from a wide variety of immunohistochemically stained slides is a tedious process in traditional histopathology due to the switching of glass slides and re-identification of regions of interest by pathologists. Digital pathology now allows us to apply image registration algorithms to digitized whole-slides to align the differing immunohistochemical stains automatically. However, registration algorithms need to be robust to changes in color due to differing stains and severe changes in tissue content between slides. In this work we developed a robust registration methodology to allow for fast coarse alignment of multiple immunohistochemical stains to the base hematyoxylin and eosin stained image. We applied HSD color model conversion to obtain a less stain color dependent representation of the whole-slide images. Subsequently, optical density thresholding and connected component analysis were used to identify the relevant regions for registration. Template matching using normalized mutual information was applied to provide initial translation and rotation parameters, after which a cost function-driven affine registration was performed. The algorithm was validated using 40 slides from 10 prostate cancer patients, with landmark registration error as a metric. Median landmark registration error was around 180 microns, which indicates performance is adequate for practical application. None of the registrations failed, indicating the robustness of the algorithm.","tags":null,"title":"Automated robust registration of grossly misregistered whole-slide images with varying stains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

The digitized prostatectomy slides were annotated for cancer and noncancerous disease and coregistered to MR imaging with an interactive deformable coregistration scheme. Computer-identified features for each of the noncancerous disease categories (eg, benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH], prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia [PIN], inflammation, and atrophy) and prostate cancer were extracted. Feature selection was performed to identify the features with the highest discriminatory power. The performance of these five features was evaluated by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).High-b-value diffusion-weighted images were more discriminative in distinguishing BPH from prostate cancer than apparent diffusion coefficient, which was most suitable for distinguishing PIN from prostate cancer. The focal appearance of lesions on dynamic contrast-enhanced images may help discriminate atrophy and inflammation from cancer. Which imaging features are discriminative for different benign lesions is influenced by cancer grade. The apparent diffusion coefficient appeared to be the most discriminative feature in identifying high-grade cancer. Classification results showed increased performance by taking into account specific benign types (AUC = 0.70) compared with grouping all noncancerous findings together (AUC = 0.62).The best features with which to discriminate prostate cancer from noncancerous benign disease depend on the type of benign disease and cancer grade.

Most automated grading algorithms work on preselected image patches as they are too computationally expensive to calculate on the multi-gigapixel whole-slide images. An automated multi-resolution cancer detection system could reduce the computational workload for subsequent grading and quantification in two ways: by excluding areas of definitely normal tissue within a single specimen or by excluding entire specimens which do not contain any cancer. In this work we present a multi-resolution cancer detection algorithm geared towards the latter. The algorithm methodology is as follows: at a coarse resolution the system uses superpixels, color histograms and local binary patterns in combination with a random forest classifier to assess the likelihood of cancer. The five most suspicious superpixels are identified and at a higher resolution more computationally expensive graph and gland features are added to refine classification for these superpixels. Our methods were evaluated in a data set of 204 digitized whole-slide H and E stained images of MR-guided biopsy specimens from 163 patients. A pathologist exhaustively annotated the specimens for areas containing cancer. The performance of our system was evaluated using ten-fold cross-validation, stratified according to patient. Image-based receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was subsequently performed where a specimen containing cancer was considered positive and specimens without cancer negative.

However, it requires a substantial amount of expertise and time from radiologists to accurately report on prostate MRI. Furthermore, quantitative analysis is needed for accurate assessment of cancer aggressiveness in vivo. Computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) systems are excellent tools to tackle these challenges. In this thesis the design of such a systems is discussed. CAD systems are typically a connected pipeline of differing algorithms performing consecutive tasks, for example segmentation, feature extraction and classification. We followed a similar outline in this thesis. In Chapter 2 we discuss the segmentation of the prostate capsule in the setting of a 'grand challenge'. Further division of the prostate capsule in distinct anatomical zones is the topic of Chapter 3. After segmentation of the capsule and the prostate zones, features discriminative for cancer and cancer aggression are discussed in Chapter 4 and 5. The interconnection of the components into one unified CAD system is subsequently discussed in Chapter 6 and the evaluation of the system in a clinical setting in Chapter 7. In this last Chapter we not only show that designing a fully automated CAD system is feasbile, but that it can be used to the benefit of radiologists.","tags":null,"title":"Computerized detection of cancer in multi-parametric prostate MRI","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"d8b6b2664097ed985020f0909851c898","permalink":"https://geertlitjens.nl/media/vox-famelab/","publishdate":"2019-04-23T21:32:50+02:00","relpermalink":"/media/vox-famelab/","section":"media","summary":"Interview about my participation in FameLab in 2015.","tags":[],"title":"Interview with Vox about FameLab","type":"media"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"ASAP (Automated Slide Analysis Platform) was developed by the Computation Pathology Group, part of the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, at the Radboud University Medical Center.

Segmentation is useful for various tasks, e.g. to accurately localize prostate boundaries for radiotherapy or to initialize multi-modal registration algorithms. In the past, it has been difficult for research groups to evaluate prostate segmentation algorithms on multi-center, multi-vendor and multi-protocol data. Especially because we are dealing with MR images, image appearance, resolution and the presence of artifacts are affected by differences in scanners and/or protocols, which in turn can have a large influence on algorithm accuracy. The Prostate MR Image Segmentation (PROMISE12) challenge was setup to allow a fair and meaningful comparison of segmentation methods on the basis of performance and robustness. In this work we will discuss the initial results of the online PROMISE12 challenge, and the results obtained in the live challenge workshop hosted by the MICCAI2012 conference. In the challenge, 100 prostate MR cases from 4 different centers were included, with differences in scanner manufacturer, field strength and protocol. A total of 11 teams from academic research groups and industry participated. Algorithms showed a wide variety in methods and implementation, including active appearance models, atlas registration and level sets. Evaluation was performed using boundary and volume based metrics which were combined into a single score relating the metrics to human expert performance. The winners of the challenge where the algorithms by teams Imorphics and ScrAutoProstate, with scores of 85.72 and 84.29 overall. Both algorithms where significantly better than all other algorithms in the challenge (p","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation of prostate segmentation algorithms for MRI: The PROMISE12 challenge","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

We investigate the effect of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) on the diagnostic accuracy of prostate MRI reporting. METHOD AND MATERIALS Two consecutive cohorts of patients were used. One for training/development of the CAD system (347 patients) and one for the prospective evaluation (130 patients). Both cohorts comprise mpMRI and subsequent MR-guided biopsy and pathology. The mpMRIs were ESUR guideline compliant and performed on a Siemens 3T MRI without the use of an endo-rectal coil. Both cohorts were prospectively reported by one of ten radiologists according to the PI-RADS guidelines. Experience of the radiologists ranged from inexperienced to very experienced (1-20 years). The computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system comprised of a voxel classification stage and a subsequent candidate segmentation and classification stage. Features include quantified T2, ADC, pharmacokinetics, texture and anatomical characteristics. ROC and FROC analysis was used to evaluate performance. For the prospective validation the CAD system assigned a score to each radiologist-identified lesion. Logistic regression combining the radiologist and CAD scores was used to emulate independent, prospective CAD reading. Subsequently, the diagnostic performance in detecting intermediate-to-high-grade cancer of the CAD system alone, the radiologist alone and the radiologist CAD-system combination was evaluated using sensitivity and specificity for the different PI-RADS thresholds. Bootstrapping was used to assess significance. RESULTS FROC analyses showed that the CAD system could detect 82% of all intermediate-to-high-grade lesions at 1 false positive per case. Combined CAD and radiologist score significantly improved the sensitivity at a PI-RADS 4 threshold over the radiologist alone (0.98 for the combination, 0.93 for the radiologist alone, p = 0.029). A significantly improved specificity was found at a PI-RADS threshold of 3 (0.25 versus 0.09, p = 0.013). CONCLUSION CAD can achieve excellent performance. As a second observer to characterize prostate lesions it can improve sensitivity and specificity in discriminating intermediate-to-high-grade cancer. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION Improving the performance of mpMRI in the detection of prostate cancer by CAD can prevent unnecessary biopsies.","tags":null,"title":"Computer-aided Detection of Prostate Cancer in Multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being increasingly used as a modality to detect prostate cancer. Therefore, computer-aided detection of prostate cancer in MRI images has become an active area of research. In this paper we investigate a fully automated computer-aided detection system which consists of two stages. In the first stage, we detect initial candidates using multi-atlas-based prostate segmentation, voxel feature extraction, classification and local maxima detection. The second stage segments the candidate regions and using classification we obtain cancer likelihoods for each candidate. Features represent pharmacokinetic behavior, symmetry and appearance, among others. The system is evaluated on a large consecutive cohort of 347 patients with MR-guided biopsy as the reference standard. This set contained 165 patients with cancer and 182 patients without prostate cancer. Performance evaluation is based on lesion-based free-response receiver operating characteristic curve and patient-based receiver operating characteristic analysis. The system is also compared to the prospective clinical performance of radiologists. Results show a sensitivity of 0.42, 0.75, and 0.89 at 0.1, 1, and 10 false positives per normal case. In clinical workflow the system could potentially be used to improve the sensitivity of the radiologist. At the high specificity reading setting, which is typical in screening situations, the system does not perform significantly different from the radiologist and could be used as an independent second reader instead of a second radiologist. Furthermore, the system has potential in a first-reader setting.","tags":null,"title":"Computer-aided detection of prostate cancer in MRI","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G. Litjens","H.

MR-guided biopsies were performed in 130 consecutive patients with cancer-suspicious regions (CSRs) on multiparametric MR images obtained at 3 T. In this retrospective study, 88 patients met the inclusion criteria.

Materials and Methods: A consecutive patient cohort of 254 patients who underwent both a detection MRI between January 1st, 2012 and December 31st, 2012 and a subsequent MR guided biopsy were included in this study. All patients were prospectively reported by one radiologist according to the PI-RADS guidelines. In total 10 different radiologists reported patients in this cohort. Of these 10 radiologists, 2 radiologist can be considered experts (19 and 12 years of experience with prostate MRI) and 8 can be considered inexperienced (3 years or less experience with prostate MRI). Together, the 2 experienced readers reported 108 patients and 146 were reported by the 8 inexperienced readers The radiologists reported 436 lesions in these patients of which 339 were biopsied. Of these 339 biopsied lesions 190 were prostate cancer. Of these 190 prostate cancer 127 lesions had a Gleason 4 or higher component and were considered high-grade prostate cancer, all others were considered low grade. The distribution of non-cancers, low-grade cancers and high-grade cancer was similar between the inexperienced and experienced observers (44%/19%/36% vs. 46%/16%/38%). Each lesion received, according to the PI-RADS guidelines, a score between 1 and 5. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated at each of the PI-RADS scores relative to the biopsy results. High-grade cancers with a PI-RADS score above or equal to the threshold are true positives. Non-cancers below the threshold were considered true negatives. This was done for both the inexperienced and experienced radiologists. Results: In total 19 PI-RADS 2, 67 PI-RADS 3, 112 PI-RADS 4 and 141 PI-RADS 5 lesions were biopsied. No PI-RADS 1 lesions were biopsied. The inexperienced reader sensitivities for PIRADS 2, 3, 4 and 5 are: 1, 1, 0.96 and 0.69 respectively. The experienced readers obtained 1, 1, 0.98 and 0.71. The corresponding specificities were 0, 0.16, 0.48 and 0.71 for the inexperienced and 0, 0.07, 0.36 and 0.76 for the experienced readers. The positive and negative predictive values were 0.46, 0.50, 0.61, 0.71 and 1, 1, 0.93, 0.74 for the inexperienced readers. For the experienced readers we obtained 0.46, 0.48, 0.57, 0.84 and 1, 1, 0.96, 0.78 respectively. Conclusion: In this population we can see that especially PI-RADS 4 and 5 classifications have excellent sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV characteristics. From this data we conclude that only PI-RADS 4 and 5 lesions require biopsy; inexperienced and experienced readers have sensitivities of 0.96 and 0.98 at this threshold. Experience matters: the number of unnecessary biopsies in PI-RADS 5 lesions reduces from 29/100 to 16/100 between experienced and inexperienced readers. Clinical relevance: PI-RADS reported lesions may help reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies. The strong effect of experience emphasizes the need for adequately trained radiologists for reporting prostate MR.","tags":null,"title":"Initial prospective evaluation of the prostate imaging reporting and data standard (PI-RADS): Can it reduce unnecessary MR guided biopsies?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Intra- and interpatient variation of PZ ADCs was determined by means of repeated measurements of normal ADCs at three magnetic resonance (MR) examinations in a retrospective cohort of 10 consecutive patients who had high prostate-specific antigen levels and negative findings at transrectal ultrasonographically-guided biopsy. In these patients, no signs of PZ cancer were found at all three MR imaging sessions. The effect of interpatient variation on the assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness was examined in a second retrospective cohort of 51 patients with PZ prostate cancer.

Therefore, CAD applications are being developed to aid radiologists in detecting prostate cancer. Existing CAD applications focus on the prostate as a whole. However, in clinical practice transition zone cancer and peripheral zone cancer are considered to have different appearances. In this paper we present zone-specific CAD, in addition to an atlas based segmentation technique which includes zonal segmentation. Our CAD system consists of a detection and a classification stage. Prior to the detection stage the prostate is segmented into two zones. After segmentation features are extracted. Subsequently a likelihood map is generated on which local maxima detection is performed. For each local maximum a region is segmented. In the classification stage additional shape features are calculated, after which the regions are classified. Validation was performed on 288 data sets with MR-guided biopsy results as ground truth. Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristic (FROC) analysis was used for statistical evaluation. The difference between whole-prostate and zone-specific CAD was assessed using the difference between the FROCs.

In this study we assessed whether computer-aided diagnosis using T2 texture and relaxation features can separate benign and malignant CG lesions. Materials and Methods: MR scans of 101 patients were included in this study. The reference standard was MR-guided MR biopsy. Of these patients 36 had benign disease (e.g. benign prostatic hyperplasia) and 65 had prostate cancer. Lesions were annotated on the T2W sequence using a contouring tool. A quantitative T2 relaxation map was computed using an estimator that combines the T2W and proton density images with a turbo-spin-echo signal model and a gain factor. The latter was estimated using an automatically selected muscle reference region. Several texture voxel features were computed on the resulting T2-map: co-occurrenc matrix based homogeneity, neighboring gray-level dependence matrix based texture strength, and multi-scale Gaussian derivative features. For the latter 5 scales between 2 and 12 mm and derivatives up to the second order were calculated. For the matrix based features we calculated several histogram bin sizes (8, 16 and 32) and kernel sizes (4, 8 and 12 mm). The total number of texture features was 42. A linear discriminant classifier with feature selection was trained to compute the cancer likelihood for each voxel in the lesion. A feature selection was performed in a nested cross-validation loop using 10 folds. Cross-validation was performed in a leave-one-patient-out manner. For each annotated region a summary lesion likelihood was computed using the 75th percentile of the voxel likelihoods. The diagnostic accuracy of the lesion cancer likelihood was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and bootstrapping. Results: An area under the ROC curve of 0.76 (95% bootstrap confidence interval 0.64 ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ 0.87) was obtained for determining cancer likelihood using texture features, which is similar to radiologist performance reported in the literature when they only have T2W images available, like in this study. Conclusion: A novel method for characterizing lesions in T2-weighted MRI using texture descriptors was developed. The performance is in the range of values reported in the literature for radiologists.

The purpose of this study was to develop an algorithm for automated segmentation of pelvic lymph nodes from a single seed point, as part of a CAD system for the classification of normal vs metastatic lymph nodes, and to evaluate its performance compared to other algorithms. METHODS: The authors' database consisted of pelvic MR images of 146 consecutive patients, acquired between January 2008 and April 2010. Each dataset included four different MR sequences, acquired after infusion of a lymph node specific contrast medium based on ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide. All data sets were analyzed by two expert readers who, reading in consensus, annotated and manually segmented the lymph nodes. The authors compared four segmentation algorithms: confidence connected region growing (CCRG), extended CCRG (ECC), graph cut segmentation (GCS), and a segmentation method based on a parametric shape and appearance model (PSAM). The methods were ranked based on spatial overlap with the manual segmentations, and based on diagnostic accuracy in a CAD system, with the experts' annotations as reference standard. RESULTS: A total of 2347 manually annotated lymph nodes were included in the analysis, of which 566 contained a metastasis. The mean spatial overlap (Dice similarity coefficient) was: 0.35 (CCRG), 0.57 (ECC), 0.44 (GCS), and 0.46 (PSAM). When combined with the classification system, the area under the ROC curve was: 0.805 (CCRG), 0.890 (ECC), 0.807 (GCS), 0.891 (PSAM), and 0.935 (manual segmentation). CONCLUSIONS: We identified two segmentation methods, ECC and PSAM, that achieve a high diagnostic accuracy when used in conjunction with a CAD system for classification of normal vs metastatic lymph nodes. The manual segmentations still achieve the highest diagnostic accuracy.","tags":null,"title":"Automated 3-Dimensional Segmentation of Pelvic Lymph Nodes in Magnetic Resonance Images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

A multi-stage computer aided detection scheme is proposed to help reduce perception and oversight errors in multi-parametric prostate cancer screening MRI. In addition, important features for development of computer aided detection systems for prostate cancer screening MRI are identified. A fast, robust prostate segmentation routine is used to segment the prostate, based on coupled appearance and anatomy models. Subsequently a voxel classification is performed using a support vector machine to compute an abnormality likelihood map of the prostate. This classification step is based on quantitative voxel features like the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and pharmacokinetic parameters. Local maxima in the likelihood map are found using a local maxima detector, after which regions around the local maxima are segmented. Region features are computed to represent statistical properties of the voxel features within the regions. Region classification is performed using these features, which results in a likelihood of abnormality per region. Performance was validated using a 188 patient dataset in a leave-one-patient-out manner. Ground truth was annotated by two expert radiologists. The results were evaluated using FROC analysis. The FROC curves show that inclusion of ADC and pharmacokinetic parameter features increases the performance of an automatic detection system. In addition it shows the potential of such an automated system in aiding radiologists diagnosing prostate MR, obtaining a sensitivity of respectively 74.7% and 83.4% at 7 and 9 false positives per patient.","tags":null,"title":"Automatic Computer Aided Detection of Abnormalities in Multi-Parametric Prostate MRI","type":"publication"},{"authors":["O.

METHOD AND MATERIALS: Our dataset contained the MRL images from patients who had had two MRLs as part of their clinical work-up in 2009 or 2010: one with ferumoxtran-10 and one with ferumoxytol as contrast agent. Each MRL consisted of at least a 3D T1-weighted sequence and a 3D T2*-weighted sequence. Two expert readers (an experienced radiologist and an experienced researcher), reading in consensus, interpreted each lymph node as normal or metastasized, based on the contrast uptake pattern in the T2*-weighted images, and delineated the lymph nodes in both types of MRL. Based on these delineations, quantitative measurements of the contrast-induced signal decrease were performed using histogram analysis. Measurements of signal decrease inside the lymph nodes were used to discriminate metastatic from normal nodes. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were computed to compare diagnostic accuracy, and the statistical significance of the difference between the two contrast agents was tested using the R Project for Statistical Computing and the ROCKIT software package. RESULTS: A total of 57 lymph nodes from four patients were included in the analysis, of which 7 were metastatic. The AUC was 0.96 for ferumoxtran-10-MRL, which is similar to results found in previous studies, and 0.87 for ferumoxytol-MRL.

Therefore, this study investigates the performance of zone-specific computer-aided detection (CAD) as opposed to whole-prostate CAD. METHOD AND MATERIALS 117 consecutive prostate MRI?s from 2009 were extracted from our database. 71/117 MRI?s showed no malignant findings, 26/117 patients had a PZ tumor, 20/117 a TZ tumor. The MRI?s were acquired on a 3T MR scanner (Siemens Trio Tim, Erlangen, Germany) and included T2-weighted images (T2WI), dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), and diffusion-weighted images (DWI). From DCE-MRI and DWI pharmacokinetic parameters (PK) and ADC maps were calculated respectively. Lesion locations were indicated by an expert radiologist. Histology was obtained using MR-guided biopsy or prostatectomy. A two-stage classification strategy was used. The prostate was segmented using an atlas based method including PZ and TZ. First stage voxel classification resulted in a likelihood map, in which local maxima were detected. Then, a region was segmented for each local maximum. Second stage classification resulted in a malignancy likelihood per region. Voxel features used were the T2WI intensities, PK and ADC values and blob detection values for T2WI, ADC and PK images. For the second stage 25th- and 75th-percentiles within the segmented regions were calculated for all voxel features including the initial likelihood map. Classification in both stages was performed using a whole-prostate classifier or two separate zone-specific classifiers. The first stage used linear discriminant classifiers, the second stage support vector machine classifiers. Validation was performed in a leave-one-patient-out manner.

Accurate measurement of tissue T1 before and after CA administration is thus necessary. Current T1 measurement methods are time-consuming. We propose the use of the ?reference tissue? method for fast T1 measurements concurrent with DCEMRI data acquisition, but with use of a reference phantom. METHOD AND MATERIALS The ?reference tissue? method is based on the approximation that in T1-weighted gradient echo images, signal intensity is proportional to 1/T1 ? thus signal intensity can be referenced to a tissue or a phantom with a known T1. We compared this method to the ?variable flip angle? method, most commonly used in clinical practice. We compared the ?reference tissue? method (TR/TE = 25/1.1 ms, a=40?) to the ?variable flip angle? method (TR/TE = 25/1.1 ms, a=3/5/10/15/20/25/30/35/40?), using the Eurospin T05 phantom, in which 10 out of 18 vials containing agar with varying concentrations of Gd-DTPA (T1 range: 281 ? 1384 ms) were used. RESULTS With the ?reference tissue? method, using 9 tubes successively as a reference for the remaining tube, the average error in the estimation of T1 was 8.5%, with a standard deviation of 6.1%, and was random. Using the ?variable flip angle? method, the average error was 5.7 % with a standard deviation of 3.8%. Using a two-sided Student?s t-test we found no statistically significant differences in the performance of the two methods (p-value = 0.52). CONCLUSION As DCEMRI imaging is done in a heavily T1-weighted regime, the ?reference tissue? method can be used to concurrently measure T1, and quantify CA concentration. Use of an agar phantom will require a correction for lower proton density in biological tissue. Proton density can be measured prior to CA administration, or tabulated values can be used. We demonstrated the feasibility of fast T1 measurements using a reference phantom, providing T1 maps without additional scanning time. This will allow quantification of the CA concentration throughout the DCEMRI scan, which cannot be achieved using the current clinical method. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION The use of a reference phantom for determining T1 can lead to a drastic reduction in scanning time and thus patient discomfort when compared to a regular clinical ?variable flip angle? scan.","tags":null,"title":"T1 Quantification: Variable Flip Angle Method vs Use of Reference Phantom","type":"publication"}]
