      <title>Introduction to Deep Learning in Medical Imaging</title>

      <description>This presentation was the first part of a half-a-day workshop on deep learning in medical imaging. It introduces the basic deep learning concepts, contrasts them to more traditional pattern recognition approaches, and shows some examples from the field. If you are interested in a more thorough overview of different applications, I can recommend .github.io/publication/litj-17/&#34;this publication.</description>

      <description>Most men die with, not because of prostate cancer. This high incidence-to-mortality ratio sounds like a positive trait, but comes with its own share of problems: high risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment with significant patient morbidity. To combat overtreatment, several models have been developed to assign patients to risk categories with differing treatment regimes. Although these models show good correlation with patient outcome on the group level, their benefit for the individual patient remains limited.</description>

      <description>Overview Built on the success of its predecessor, CAMELYON17 is the second grand challenge in pathology organised by the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG) and Department of Pathology of the Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc) in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.
The goal of this challenge is to evaluate new and existing algorithms for automated detection and classification of breast cancer metastases in whole-slide images of histological lymph node sections. This task has high clinical relevance and would normally require extensive microscopic assessment by pathologists.</description>
