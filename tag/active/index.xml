&lt;p>An ever-increasing amount of treatment options is available to prostate cancer patients. Although this is a positive development, it also increases the complexity of selecting the right therapy for the individual patient. The fusion of in and ex vivo information streams, such as from radiology and pathology, offers a promising avenue for improved models of disease physiology and progression, and consequently, better strategies for treatment selection. However, to build accurate models, large sets of fused radiology/pathology data are needed, which have been impossible to obtain due to the time-consuming and expensive nature of acquiring such datasets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this project, we propose an artificial-intelligence-based platform that can automatically combine large archival sets of digitized histopathological slides and multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) and leverage them to build a disease model which will improve 1) identification of clinically significant prostate cancer, 2) selection of patients for active surveillance, and 3) predict lutetium-PSMA treatment success.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project encompasses five objectives: I) establish a collection of combined mp-MRI and digitized prostatectomy specimens from 1350 patients, II) build an automated reconstruction algorithm for the generation of 3D tissue volumes from 2D digitized histopathology slides, III) develop registration techniques for spatial alignment of ex vivo histopathology to in vivo mp-MRI, IV) learn mp-MRI / histopathology correlations using unique deep streaming generative models, and V) Evaluate the learned correlations for improved diagnostics, active surveillance, and lutetium-PSMA treatment selection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The impact of the project will not just be improved diagnostic and treatment decisions for patients but can be the starting point of an entirely new field of cross-medical-specialty research; the developed platform can be leveraged for other cancer types and even non-oncological diseases.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI-supported cancer grading for more efficient and accurate histopathological diagnosis (DeepGrading)</title><link>https://geertlitjens.nl/project/ppp-deepgrading/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 15:29:21 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://geertlitjens.nl/project/ppp-deepgrading/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Optimal treatment decisions for cancer patients are hampered by variability in grading among pathologists. When there is a suspicion for cancer, typically a tissue biopsy is taken. This biopsy is stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) and evaluated by a pathologist for the presence and aggressiveness (i.e. grading) of the tumor. Professional organizations have drafted standardized guidelines on how this grading should be performed; however, there is still significant inter- and intra-observer variation among pathologists. Artificial intelligence, specifically through deep learning, has shown to increase efficiency and consistency in histopathological diagnosis, and, recently, to perform grading at the expert level. We have prototypes of such algorithms validated in the lab which could significantly impact clinical practice, but have not yet been tested in routine diagnostics. The aim of this project is three-fold.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>First, we will further develop our existing grading algorithms for prostate and breast cancer, to enhance robustness to variance in data sources and disease (sub)types. Second, we will conduct studies to determine the most efficient way to integrate algorithms into the routine workflow. Last, we will evaluate the most promising workflow prospectively in pilot lines at both peripheral and academic centers to assess performance. Currently, there are no algorithms commercially available which can do pathologist-level grading of cancer. Thus, this project can have both significant societal and economic impact. From a societal perspective, we can make expert grading available at locations without access to subspecialized pathologists. Outside the Netherlands, there are pathologist shortages in countries such as India and China where these algorithms could have even more impact. Thirona is already ISO13485 certified and has experience with CE certification and FDA 510(k) clearance. As such, upon completion of this project, algorithms could be commercially available quickly, offering the potential for a significant disruption of the health care market.&lt;/p>

This high incidence-to-mortality ratio sounds like a positive trait, but comes with its own share of problems: high risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment with significant patient morbidity. To combat overtreatment, several models have been developed to assign patients to risk categories with differing treatment regimes. Although these models show good correlation with patient outcome on the group level, their benefit for the individual patient remains limited.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Several groups have shown that quantifying the tumour and its micro-environment at the cellular level can result in biomarkers with strong prognostic potential, for example tumour/stroma ratio, the presence and composition of immune infiltrates or the amount of proliferating (Ki67-positive) cells. However, these findings have not translated to clinical practice due to the cumbersome and subjective manual extraction of these biomarkers from tissue slides.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recent years have seen the more widespread introduction of whole-slide imaging systems, which for the first time allow computerized processing of tissue slides. Automated extraction of aforementioned quantitative biomarkers through image analysis can achieve the required accuracy and robustness to impact clinical practice. In tandem with these developments, computer vision has seen a machine learning revolution over the past decade due to the advent of deep learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this project, we will combine deep learning and digitized whole-slide imaging of prostate cancer for reproducible extraction of quantitative biomarkers. Furthermore, due to the ability of deep learning systems to learn relevant features without human intervention, we expect to identify novel biomarkers which allow us to further improve the current risk models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aim of this project is to prevent unnecessary surgery and adjuvant therapy for individual patients by improving currently established risk models. Risk models will be enhanced through the addition of pre- and post-operative quantitative biomarkers obtained via image analysis and deep learning. We will focus both on the accurate and objective quantification of biomarkers already identified in literature and the discovery of novel biomarkers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DeepDerma</title><link>https://geertlitjens.nl/project/deepderma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://geertlitjens.nl/project/deepderma/</guid><description>&lt;p>Due to the tripling of skin cancer incidence over the past two decades, more skin biopsies and resections are performed than ever before. This has led to an enormous increase in workload for pathologists, who perform the microscopic diagnostics of skin samples.
Most of microscopic skin analysis is not professionally challenging, but it is time consuming and can lead to reduced time for more complex diagnostics and increased wait time for patients. Machine learning and specifically deep learning offers a path to automating the diagnoses of skin samples, which would reduce the pressure on pathologists and the cost of diagnosis, both in time and money.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We propose not just to develop an algorithm which can perform skin diagnostics at the level of an expert pathologist, but also explicitly identify the most fruitful way of integrating these algorithms into the routine workflow. This project is exceedingly timely, as by the end of 2019 all histopathological diagnostics in the Radboud University Medical Center will be done digitally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project consists of four work packages. In work package 1, we will collect a large retrospective cohort of annotated and labeled skin biopsies and resections from multiple centers. The focus of work package 2 is on development of algorithms for segmentation of different skin tissue classes, subtyping of basal cell carcinoma, and identification of rare incidental findings. Work package 3 and 4 cover the development and prospective evaluation of the optimal algorithm-integrated workflow in a real world clinical setting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After completion, we will have the worldâs first prospectively evaluated algorithm-supported workflow for digital pathology, and a valuable, expert labeled, retrospective dataset of skin specimens; both excellent targets for valorization. Last, it will increase the time of pathologists for complex diagnostics and reduce the wait time for patients.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
