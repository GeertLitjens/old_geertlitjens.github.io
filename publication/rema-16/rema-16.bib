 abstract = {Despite remarkable recent achievements of immunotherapy strategies in cancer treatment, clinical responses remain limited to subsets of patients. Predictive markers of disease course and response to immunotherapy are urgently needed. Recent results have revealed the potential predictive value of immune cell phenotype and spatial distribution at the tumor site, prompting the need for multidimensional immunohistochemical analyses of tumor tissues. To address this need, we developed a sample-sparing, highly multiplexed immunohistochemistry technique based on iterative cycles of tagging, image scanning, and destaining of chromogenic substrate on a single slide. This assay, in combination with a newly developed automated digital landscaping solution, democratizes access to high-dimensional immunohistochemical analyses by capturing the complexity of the immunome using routine pathology standards. Applications of the method extend beyond cancer to screen and validate comprehensive panels of tissue-based prognostic and predictive markers, perform indepth in situ monitoring of therapies, and identify targets of disease.},
