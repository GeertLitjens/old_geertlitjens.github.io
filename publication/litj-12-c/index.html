For the latter 5 scales between 2 and 12 mm and derivatives up to the second order were calculated. For the matrix based features we calculated several histogram bin sizes (8, 16 and 32) and kernel sizes (4, 8 and 12 mm). The total number of texture features was 42. A linear discriminant classifier with feature selection was trained to compute the cancer likelihood for each voxel in the lesion. A feature selection was performed in a nested cross-validation loop using 10 folds. Cross-validation was performed in a leave-one-patient-out manner. For each annotated region a summary lesion likelihood was computed using the 75th percentile of the voxel likelihoods. The diagnostic accuracy of the lesion cancer likelihood was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and bootstrapping. Results: An area under the ROC curve of 0.76 (95% bootstrap confidence interval 0.64 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0.87) was obtained for determining cancer likelihood using texture features, which is similar to radiologist performance reported in the literature when they only have T2W images available, like in this study. Conclusion: A novel method for characterizing lesions in T2-weighted MRI using texture descriptors was developed. The performance is in the range of values reported in the literature for radiologists. Clinical relevance: A CAD system for classification of CG lesions could improve the characterization of these lesions, which might result in better treatment planning.">
