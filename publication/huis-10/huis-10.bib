 abstract = {One in 10 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their life. PSA screening in combination with MR is likely to save lifes at low biopsy and overtreatment rates. Computer Aided Diagnosis for prostate MR will become mandatory in a high volume screening application. This paper presents an overview including our recent work in this area. It includes screening MR setup, quantitative imaging features, prostate segmentation, and pattern recognition.},
