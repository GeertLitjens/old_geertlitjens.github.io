 abstract = {The key to MR lymphography is suppression of T2* MR signal in normal lymph nodes, while retaining high signal in metastatic nodes. Our objective is to quantitatively compare the ability of ferumoxtran-10 and ferumoxytol to suppress the MR signal in normal pelvic lymph nodes. In 2010, a set of consecutive patients who underwent intravenous MR Lymphography (MRL) were included. Signal suppression in normal lymph nodes in T2*-weighted images due to uptake of USPIO (Ultra-Small Superparamagnetic Particles of Iron Oxide) was quantified. Signal suppression by two USPIO contrast agents, ferumoxtran-10 and ferumoxytol was compared using Wilcoxon's signed rank test. Forty-four patients were included, of which all 44 had a ferumoxtran-10 MRL and 4 had additionally a ferumoxytol MRL. A total of 684 lymph nodes were identified in the images, of which 174 had been diagnosed as metastatic. USPIO-induced signal suppression in normal lymph nodes was significantly stronger in ferumoxtran-10 MRL than in ferumoxytol MRL (p < 0.005). T2* signal suppression in normal pelvic lymph nodes is significantly stronger with ferumoxtran-10 than with ferumoxytol, which may affect diagnostic accuracy.},
